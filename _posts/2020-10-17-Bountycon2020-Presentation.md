I was recently invited to present at BountyCon 2020. This was supposed to early March in Singapore where flights and accomodations were all provided for. I even bought flights for my wife and son so we could take it as an opportunity for a holiday while we were there.

Sadly when Covid hit just before March, Facebook decided to postpone it and host it as a virtual conference. This was a shame as I was looking forward to meet up with some of my fellow hackers.

Anyway, below is the recorded version of the presentation. Enjoy.
